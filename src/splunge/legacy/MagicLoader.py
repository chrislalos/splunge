# The Python import machinery consists of finders and loaders.
# The finder finds the module.
# The loader loads the module.
#
# When you do 'import yourModule' in your code, the import machinery is invoked,
# and it loads *and executes* yourModule. We don't want the module executed, because
# we want to load the module up with handy stuff before executing. This is what lets
# an author of a splunge web app get away with not doing imports simply to write vanilla
# web app code. It's already loaded.
#
# So anyway, we want to load the module and not execute it, which is why we can't import
# the module, even programatically because import = load + execute. But we can study the
# code behind import, and see how it loads the module, and steal that code. Which is what
# the code below does: the little bit of code below was the result of studying the import
# code. That's why the code is weird; it's weird because the import machinery is weird.
#
# This became possible in Python 3 (or maybe a later 2.x - I can't recall), when 
# the core import code got moved from C to Python.

def loadModule (path):
	# Simple filename / path stuff
	(folder, filename) = os.path.split(path)
	# print("folder=" + folder)
	# print("filename=" + filename)
	(moduleName, dot, extension) = filename.rpartition('.')
	# print("(moduleName, dot, extension)=({}, {}, {})".format(moduleName, dot, extension))
	ext = splunge.util.get_file_extension(path)

	# Enter the weirdness: pass a (loader class, file extension) tuple, wrapped in a list, to
	# the c'tor of importlib's FileFinder. Use the file finder to 'find' a module spec (which
	# is sort of metainfo on a module), then use import machinery to turn the spec into a 
	# module.
	# loaderArgs = (SourceFileLoader, ext)
	# finder = FileFinder(folder, loaderArgs)
	finder = splunge.urilcreate_file_finder
	spec = finder.find_spec(moduleName)

	if not spec:
		raise splunge.ModuleNotFoundEx(moduleName)
	module = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
	print("module=" + str(module))

	# And now a final weird trick: In python loaders are responsible for execution as well,
	# which seems like an unnecessary coupling. They get away with it because import = load+execute
	# and so decoupling load and execution is not a priority for Python. But it is for splunge.
	# So as a bit of syntactic sugar we add an 'exec' function to the module, which is just a lambda
	# that calls exec_module() on the loader.
	# @todo Think about the implications, of clobbering exec() if exec() happened to exist in the module.
	# @note I think modules are assigned a spec field upon loading so this next statement might not be necessary
	# @note If none of the local variables here are necessary for module execution, then this lambda assignment
	#       could happen at module enrichment time ... or skipped in favor of an explicit call.
	#       ie module.__spec__.loader.exec_module(module)
	module.exec = lambda: spec.loader.exec_module(module)
